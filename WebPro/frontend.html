                                </ul>
                                <h4>Background</h4>
                                <p>Kerala, a southern state in India, is prone to heavy monsoon rains and flooding. In August 2018, the state witnessed one of the worst flood events in its history. During this time, the region experienced unprecedented levels of rainfall, leading to widespread flooding and landslides.</p>
                                <h4>Solar PV Plant</h4>
                                <p>The case study focuses on a 5 MW solar PV plant located in the flood-affected region of Kerala. The solar plant had been operational for two years before the flood incident occurred, providing clean energy to the local grid.</p>
                                <h4>Flood Event</h4>
                                <p>Continuous heavy rainfall over a 10-day period resulted in severe flooding across Kerala. The solar PV plant site was inundated by floodwaters, submerging a significant portion of the plant infrastructure, including solar panels, inverters, and electrical components.</p>
                                <h4>Economic Impact</h4>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><b>Infrastructure Damage:</b> The floodwaters caused substantial damage to the solar panels, leading to corrosion and electrical short-circuits. The inverters and other electrical equipment were also affected by the inundation.</li>
                                    <li><b>Downtime and Energy Loss:</b> The flooded solar plant had to be shut down for safety reasons and to assess the damage. This led to a total energy production loss of approximately 400 megawatt-hours (MWh) during the 10-day flood period.</li>
                                    <li><b>Repair and Restoration Costs:</b> The repair and restoration efforts included replacing damaged solar panels, inverters, electrical components, and support structures. The total costs for these repairs amounted to INR 1.2 million.</li>
                                    <li><b>Opportunity Costs:</b> The downtime resulted in missed revenue opportunities. The solar plant's average daily revenue generation was approximately INR 75,000, translating to a total revenue loss of INR 750,000 during the 10-day flood period.</li>
                                </ol>
                                <h4>Total Economic Loss Calculation</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Infrastructure Damage and Repair Costs:</b> INR 1.2 million</li>
                                    <li><b>Lost Energy Production:</b> 400 MWh * Market Price of Electricity</li>
                                    <li><b>Missed Revenue:</b> INR 750,000</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                                <p>The case study of the solar PV plant in Kerala, India, highlights the real economic impact of floods on renewable energy infrastructure. The combination of infrastructure damage, repair costs, lost energy production, and missed revenue underscores the need for comprehensive climate resilience strategies in the renewable energy sector. As climate change-induced extreme events become more frequent, such case studies emphasize the importance of incorporating adaptive measures to mitigate potential economic losses.</p>
